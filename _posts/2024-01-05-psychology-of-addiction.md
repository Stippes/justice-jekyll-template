Most of us have felt it: the itch to open Instagram, TikTok, or that news app — again.

## The Hook Model

Many apps are based on a behavioral loop that looks like this:

1. **Trigger** – A notification or internal urge.
2. **Action** – Opening the app.
3. **Variable reward** – You might see something exciting... or nothing.
4. **Investment** – You comment, like, or post something new, increasing the chance you’ll return.

This loop taps into our dopamine system.

## Emotional Triggers

But it’s not just about notifications. Apps often succeed because they tap into:

- Loneliness
- FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- Boredom
- Anxiety

...

## What Can We Do?

Start by noticing your urges. Then consider tools like:

- “One Sec” to pause app opening
- Turning off notifications
- Greyscale mode

> Technology doesn’t just serve our attention — it shapes it.

### ✅ Summary:

- ✅ **Use Markdown** freely: headings (`##`), bold (`**bold**`), italics (`_italic_`), lists, blockquotes, etc.
- ⚠️ Use HTML *only if you need special formatting*, like custom classes or embedding iframes.
