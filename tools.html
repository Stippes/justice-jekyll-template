  <p><strong>Even the most advanced AI system can be resisted—if you understand how it works on you.</strong> This Toolkit offers hands-on strategies to reduce the influence of manipulative algorithms on your attention, emotions, and decisions.</p>

  <h3>🧭 Digital Habits Checklist</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Install the “One Sec” app:</strong> Adds a 1-second delay before opening addictive apps, helping break unconscious habits.</li>
    <li><strong>Turn off autoplay:</strong> Disable automatic video playback on YouTube, Netflix, and TikTok to regain agency over your time.</li>
    <li><strong>Use greyscale mode:</strong> Set your phone screen to grayscale during evenings or work hours to reduce visual temptation.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove algorithmic feeds:</strong> Replace recommendation-driven apps with chronological versions (e.g., RSS readers, unbundled YouTube).</li>
    <li><strong>Turn off personalized ads:</strong> Visit your Google and Meta ad settings to minimize micro-targeting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛡️ Recommended Browser Extensions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>uBlock Origin:</strong> Blocks ads and trackers to reduce attention-hijacking noise.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Badger:</strong> Automatically learns and blocks invisible trackers.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent-O-Matic:</strong> Auto-fills GDPR cookie forms to say “no” to tracking—every time.</li>
    <li><strong>DF Tube:</strong> Hides YouTube’s recommendations and comments, letting you focus on your intention.</li>
    <li><strong>News Feed Eradicator:</strong> Replaces social media feeds with motivational quotes or neutral backgrounds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧠 Emotional Awareness Tips</h3>
  <p>Manipulative systems often target emotional triggers—especially outrage, fear, and FOMO. Here's how to resist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pause before clicking or reacting to emotionally charged content.</li>
    <li>Ask yourself: “Who benefits if I act on this impulse?”</li>
    <li>Use journaling or brief mindfulness exercises when feeling hijacked by digital emotion loops.</li>
    <li>Don’t engage with bots: always verify who (or what) you’re talking to.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>💬 Safe Practices When Using Chatbots</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don't overshare:</strong> Remember that some systems use your inputs to personalize or profile you.</li>
    <li><strong>Use clear boundaries:</strong> Avoid long emotional conversations with bots. They're not your friend—even if they seem like it.</li>
    <li><strong>Take regular breaks:</strong> Use short, timed sessions with tools like “Focus Keeper” or Pomodoro apps.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask “who trained this bot?”:</strong> Check the company, their business model, and their AI disclosures.</li>
  </ul>
