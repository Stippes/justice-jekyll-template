# Alethia AI

This site uses the Justice Jekyll theme to present **Alethia**, an open initiative exposing and mitigating AI-driven manipulation online.

Alethia blends behavioral research with technical audits to help the public see how recommendation engines, chatbots and social media feeds shape our decisions. The project supplies tools, policy explainers and selfâ€‘defense checklists so users can reclaim their digital autonomy.
