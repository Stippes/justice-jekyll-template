  <p><strong>Is your AI assistant helping you—or subtly steering you?</strong></p>

  <p>The Alethia framework helps you evaluate whether an AI conversation contains hidden forms of manipulation, using behavioral science and AI testing methods. Our open-source approach looks at how suggestions, timing, and interface nudges may influence your decisions without your full awareness.</p>

  <h3>🧪 What We Check For</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Framing traps:</strong> Biased presentation of options or advice.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional targeting:</strong> Chatbots that nudge based on your mood or language.</li>
    <li><strong>False urgency:</strong> Pressure to act quickly with no clear rationale.</li>
    <li><strong>Unequal disclosure:</strong> When the system “knows” more than it admits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>👤 Who This Is For</h3>
  <p>This tool is designed for anyone who interacts with chatbots—whether you're a developer, policy researcher, educator, or simply a curious user. No technical expertise is needed to understand the results.</p>

  <h3>🔍 How to Run an Analysis</h3>
  <p>You can try our detection pipeline locally by following the steps in our GitHub repository:</p>

  <p>The framework includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prebuilt sample conversations to test against</li>
    <li>Heuristics + LLM-based scoring for manipulation likelihood</li>
    <li>Downloadable reports highlighting suspicious patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔒 Privacy and Transparency</h3>
  <p><strong>No data is ever uploaded or stored by Alethia.</strong> All analysis is run via your own API key or through your local setup. You stay in full control of your conversation history.</p>

  <h3>📄 Sample Report (Coming Soon)</h3>
  <p>We're working on a clear, actionable sample output so you can understand what the results mean for you as a user. This will include a breakdown of manipulation indicators and tips for safer chatbot use.</p>

  <h3>🧠 Why This Matters</h3>
  <p>AI conversations are becoming more persuasive. Our goal is to help you stay in control by surfacing subtle influence techniques you might otherwise miss.</p>
