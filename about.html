      <p><strong>Alethia AI seeks to reclaim human agency in the age of intelligent systems.</strong> We equip citizens and institutions to understand ‚Äî and resist ‚Äî how AI systems shape behavior, choices, and perception.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a future where AI systems are aligned with humanistic values. Where technology promotes autonomy, dignity, and democratic participation ‚Äî not just engagement or efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Empower citizens:</strong> We provide knowledge and tools to help everyone recognize and resist manipulative AI systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Support ethical innovation:</strong> We collaborate with technical experts to develop and test alternatives to engagement-based metrics ‚Äî ones that prioritize genuine well-being.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>Alethia began as a conversation between a behavioral scientist and an AI engineer ‚Äî both alarmed by how reinforcement learning systems were optimizing for shallow metrics like screen time and dopamine hits. Inspired by the early 2010s social media crisis, we decided not to let history repeat itself.</p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>üîç Detect:</strong> We analyze chatbot logs, interface flows, and design patterns for signs of manipulation.</li>
        <li><strong>üß† Explain:</strong> We decode complex AI policies and psychological research into actionable tools.</li>
        <li><strong>üõ°Ô∏è Equip:</strong> We create frameworks, toolkits, and campaigns that empower users and guide policymakers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rooted in behavioral science and psychological realism</li>
        <li>Focused on user-side literacy and practical agency</li>
        <li>Not just critique ‚Äî but methods for testing, measuring, and pushing back</li>
        <li>Actively working to reshape industry incentives toward ethical optimization</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <p>We are interdisciplinary researchers, developers, and designers committed to helping people navigate digital life with clarity and control.</p>
