        <p><strong>Every day, millions of people interact with AI systems that nudge, shape, and sometimes exploit human behavior.</strong> Most don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs happening. Alethia AI is here to change that.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Alethia began as a conversation between a behavioral scientist and a machine learning engineer ‚Äî both alarmed by how AI systems were quietly shaping choices in therapy, politics, and everyday life. We saw a gap: there were tools to build persuasive AI, but none for defending against it. So we started one.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>üîç Detect:</strong> We analyze chatbot logs, app flows, and design patterns for signs of manipulative influence.</li>
          <li><strong>üß† Explain:</strong> We translate AI ethics, policy, and behavioral science into tools anyone can use.</li>
          <li><strong>üõ°Ô∏è Equip:</strong> We build and share defensive strategies for professionals, policymakers, and the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We love technology. But ethical AI must respect autonomy and avoid exploiting vulnerabilities. Alethia focuses on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Evidence over hype</li>
          <li>Empowerment over fear</li>
          <li>Open methods over closed models</li>
          <li>Bridging policy, practice, and lived experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>We‚Äôre researchers, developers, and designers working across disciplines to help people reclaim agency in digital life.</p>
